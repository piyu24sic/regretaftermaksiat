        <h2>My Routine</h2>
        <p>
        </p>every morning I always wake up at 04.00 or 05.00 after that I wash my face to make it look fresh and then make my bed to make it look neat. At 05.30 I go to the market to buy cooking ingredients such as chicken spices and others. After returning from the market I will most likely cook my favorite food, namely nuclear chicken, believe me, it is very delicious. When the food is cooked I will eat it because at 08.00 I have to go to campus. After eating of course I will take a shower while washing my clothes. After doing this I make coffee to start my morning activities before leaving for college.</p>

  </p>When I arrived at campus I greeted my friends to strengthen my attitude and friendship. Usually, I joked with my friends while waiting for the lecturer to enter the class. When the lecturer slowly arrived in my class I began to seriously understand what lessons the lecturer would teach until completion.</p>

  </p>In the end, when I finished the lecture I went home to clean the house after that I took a shower to buy necessities for the next day. When I had done these things I would sleep for an hour to recover my energy. When 8:00 pm came I started playing with my friends until 10:00 am after that I went to bed.
